##Sports League App


Step one: Think up a better name.

This will be a single-page web app that keeps track of wins and losses, leagues, and other interesting statistics. It will allow a user to create and edit leagues. Also, a user will be able to see all their statistics visualized as graphs, pie charts, etc.



##Functionality

A user will be able to login and add a league, see his leagues, see standings and other statistics and maybe even schedules games. A user will be able to see their match history including who they played against and the score.

An admin user will be able to use the 'game' form to add games that have been played which will update standings and individual player stats.

##It is in the very early stages right now.
