##Sports League App

This will be a single-page web app that keeps track of wins and losses, leagues, and other interesting statistics. It will allow a user to create and edit leagues. Also, a user will be able to see all their statistics visualized as graphs, pie charts, etc.

It was originally made using the MEAN stack, but I am going to use Ember.js as a frontend framework because I haven't worked with it on a large scale before. So MEEN stack it is!

##Functionality

A user will be able to login and add a league, see his leagues, see standings and other statistics and maybe even schedules games. A user will be able to see their match history including who they played against and the score.

An admin user will be able to use the 'game' form to add games that have been played which will update standings and individual player stats.

##It is in the very early stages right now, I haven't even taken the Angular out and put the Ember in.
