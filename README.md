##Ping Pong Standings

This is a single-page web app that keeps track of ping pong wins/losses.

It is made using the MEAN stack, or at least it will be when finished.

I am thinking of extending the functionality past ping pong.

##Functionality

A user will be able to login and add a league, see his leagues, see standings, and 

maybe even schedules games.

An admin user will be able to use the 'game' form to add games that have been played

which will update standings and individual player stats.
